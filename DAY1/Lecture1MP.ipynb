    "    How does Google rank web pages? In this example, we will look at a simplified model for ranking web pages. The main idea is that a web page has a higher rank if many pages (with high rank) links to this page. The problem is recursive. In order to calculate the rank of one page, you need to know the ranks of the other pages. Another way to look at this is to think of a person that randomly clicks on one of the links of a homepage. After random browsing, the page rank is the probability that you are on a certain homepage. In order to connect all homepages one has the idea that with a small probability (say 15 percent) one jumps to a totally random homepage. Let's look at a toy example. Assume that there are four homepages on the internet, 1 - 'Immersive Math', 2 - 'Linear Algebra', 3 - 'Boolean Algebra' and 4 - 'Boring Algebra'.\n",
